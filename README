Hi, I'm Orik!

I am a modular script management utility. (it's not that complicated, honest!)

You can run me from anywhere, and I will execute your chosen modules in your current directory.

Think of me as your central, modular script system.

I'm also a pretty cool dwarf :)

-- Running a module --

Ensure that your desired module is in the orik/modules directory.

To run a module, simple type orik/orik run MODULENAME. It's that simple.

-- Setting up automatic running of modules --

You can edit config.txt's MODULES array to create a list of modules that should be automatically run. These are run when you enter the "orik/orik run all" command.

I hope you like me! (please do, please do!)

Hi, I'm Orik!

You can write modules for me in your preferred shell scripting language, and then place them in the modules/ directory!

To run a module, simple type ./orik run MODULENAME from the orik directory. 

-- Setting up automatic running of modules --

You can edit config.txt's MODULES array to create a list of modules that should be automatically run. These are run when you enter the "./orik run all" command.

I hope you like me! (please do, please do!)
